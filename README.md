Healing the Rainbow Site

Healing the Rainbow (HTR) is for women who want to reinvent themselves and live life authentically on their terms. Who want to rediscover who they are by taking the pieces of their history and rewriting "her-story."

Product Overview <br>
This website had a four-page layout including home, about us, shop, and contact pages. All pages had a sleek and modern design feel to give the brand an eye-catching appeal.

Front End <br>
I used React for the front end, styled with the styled-components library, and Framer Motion for all animations. There were custom stylings, animations, and components made in HTML and CSS as well.

Back End <br>
I didn't have much of a back-end since I used Email JS for contact emailing, Calendly API for scheduling, and Netlify for hosting and deployment. These services provided their own back-end framework so I didn't have to build one.

See it for yourself!
