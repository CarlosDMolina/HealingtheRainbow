        paragraph: 'I can happily say that this woman is one of the most influential women in my life. I place her right up there with my mother. I am a multiple rape survivor and each one was a complete emotional storm. For seven years I suffered before I sought counseling. After I was able to work through the rapes, I still had to deal with myself and how I looked at myself and felt about myself. Getting to know me and who I was inside and out was truly a battle but working with my Coach Shafiah was the most wonderful thing. Her confidence in me helped me to see the confidence in myself. This new confidence in myself has allowed me to follow some of my dreams. This woman is a Gift from the Creator, and I will always adore her.'

        paragraph: 'Broken from so many hurts and emotionally bound by the cares of life; being a wife, being a mother, while still having a full-time career begin to take a huge toll on me. Through the counsel, encouragement, and wisdom from my sister and friend Shafiah Khabeerah, she begins to speak life and empowerment into my very spirit-man. Those moments of confiding in her help me to get through so many mountains in my life and for that I am grateful. The gift she has is for such women as that and I encourage you to reach out to her Ministry when you find yourself in a place of self-doubt, low self-esteem, or no self-worth and watch how her words bring life into every area of your life!'

She's shown me that no matter how many curveballs life throws us we have to catch them and keep going! No matter what people say or think of you keep your head up and be your own you! I remember beating myself up about a mistake I made that I never wanted to make but she said, \"baby girl EVERYONE has to go through tests to have a TESTimony\" and that was just something you had to go through to help someone out in the long run. Don't beat yourself up about it. Learn from your mistakes and keep pushing to do better!"

        paragraph: "Shafiah you've done a lot for me. You have uplifted not just me but others in the community. You've helped me to see what was missing in my life was God and believing in myself. Spiritually you showed me how to believe for me to heal and stay strong not just for me but for my son. You also helped inspire me to be strong enough for me to tell people how I feel so they'll stop taking advantage of me. I also believe you've inspired the kids at the Women's Leadership summer program. You also help where you can and help everyone to see that they are important. You have done an excellent job taking the reins of the Women's Leadership Program."
